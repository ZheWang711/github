In this part, we have three programs. 
First: quicksort_MPI 
This program has two parameters.
Size of array and number of nodes.
We assume the size of array is 1000 and number of nodes is 2
So, we can run this program like this : mpirun --hostfile hosts -np 2 ./quicksort_MPI 1000 2

Second: quicksort_topology 
This program has two parameters.
Size of array and number of nodes.
We assume the size of array is 1000 and number of nodes is 2
So, we can run this program like this : mpirun --hostfile hosts -np 2 ./quicksort_topology 1000 2

Third: hybrid
This program has three parameters.
Size of array , number of nodes and number of threads.
We assume the size of array is 1000 and number of nodes is 2 and thread number is 2
So, we can run this program like this : mpirun --hostfile hosts -np 2 ./quicksort_MPI 1000 2 2
